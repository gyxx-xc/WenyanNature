- [x] crafting
  - change needed
- [x] muti-tick javacall
- [x] non-block runner logic
  - running as same, slot in the inventory for import
- [ ] power generate and consume
  - two types of power, disappear every 2 tick, need to calculate power generate and consume every tick
  - small power (天意) gen by a**b mod 1e9+9 O(log b) about 30 op (less than 1 tick for normal fastest), c = 25
  - large power (天机) gen by log_a(b) mod 1e9+9 O(sqrt(b)) about 3e4 op (1.5*c sec for fastest)
  - design power consume api
- [ ] some more function
- [ ] running state save and load
- [ ] docker block
- [ ] docs
- [ ] CHS/CHT opencc version
  - opencc library
  - CHT to CHS will make different character to same. e.g. 隣邻
  - treatment to symbols
- [ ] error handler
  - may need to totally rewrite
  - show error on gui
- [ ] asm jit compiler
- [ ] annotation wenyan value processor
  - need source level annotation processing
- [ ] variable symbol unify
  - variable symbol in runtime need to separate to wenyan grammar
  - at least able to change the whole pre-defined variable symbol set
