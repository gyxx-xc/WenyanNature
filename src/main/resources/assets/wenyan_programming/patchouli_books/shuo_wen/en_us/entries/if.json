It allows the program to make decisions based on certain conditions.\n\nIn Wenyan, the syntax for an if statement is as follows:\n\n```\n若 (condition) {\n    // code to execute if condition is true\n} 否则若 (another_condition) {\n    // code to execute if another_condition is true\n} 否则 {\n    // code to execute if none of the above conditions are true\n}\n```\n\nHere, `若` means 'if', `否则若` means 'else if', and `否则` means 'else'. The conditions are evaluated in order, and the first true condition will execute its corresponding code block. If none of the conditions are true, the code block under `否则` will be executed."
